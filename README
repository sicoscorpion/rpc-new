=================THE ACADIA ROBOTICS REGISTRATION DATABASE===================

===WHO=======================================================================
This project was written by James Walsh and Fady Abdelmohsen, with help from 
Dr. Darcy Benoit and Martin Main in 2015-16 for Acadia Robotics, to replace 
an older database implementation. The backend system was primarily written by
Fady Abdelmohsen, the frontend by James Walsh, and the documentation by 
Martin Main. Dr. Darcy Benoit was consulted for help with the database
design.

===WHAT======================================================================
The purpose of the registration database is to provide a single database to 
manage all of the registration information for competition participants, 
teams, coaches, volunteers and administrators. The Scope of the project at
the time of writing (April 2016), is to include basic information such as 
name, email, street address, role in competition, etc for those involved in 
the competition, and to keep this information from year to year to be used 
for record keeping. 

It is implemented as a MySql Database being stored on one of Acadia 
University's servers, as well as a front end access component to allow people 
to register, and administrators to access data.


===HOW THIS APPLICATION IS ORGANIZED=========================================
This application uses two fully separate backend and front end components. 
The backend is simply an API that takes requests and returns JSON encoded
data.The front end is a web browser accessible user interface that makes 
requests to the backend and shows data to the user asynchronously.


===========================BASIC FOLDER STRUCTURE============================
/api-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Contains the source code for the back-end database api. 
	
	/api/libs 			
	-Contains the libraries used for the back-end.

		/api/libs/Slim
		-The Slim php library which is a framework for creating the API 
	
	/api/v1			
	-Contains the code for version 1 of the api.
		
		/api/v1/model
		-Provides a set of abstract classes that represent the different 
		objects in the database. Handles database access queries.
		
		/api/v1/routes
		-Provides a set of functions that detect and direct the various 
		types of requests to the correct classes in the model. These 
		functions also provide validation checking and the sending of 
		actual responses the API.

		/api/v1/config.php
		-Contains the default configuration settings for the database

		/api/v1/config-algol.php
		-Contains the configuration settings for the system when it is up on
		the algol server.

		/api/v1/dbHelper.php
		-Contains a class which abstractifies much of the database access
		functionality for the database system.

		/api/v1/index.php
		-Contains the base file for the API. Initializes the Slim app and
		includes all the required files for the API. 

/app-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Contains the source code for the front end application.

	/app/images
	-Contains the images used in the front end app.
	
	/app/js
	-Contains the Angular JS Java Script code used in the application.
	
		/app/js/controllers
		-Contains all the Angular JS control files that link up with all 
		the views.
		
		/app/js/directives
		-Contains the Angular JS directives for adding special 
		functionality.
		
		/app/js/services
		-Contains the Angular JS services used in the application. This 
		folder contains data.js which creates the Data service which is
		the abstraction that actually makes the queries to the back end 
		system.

	/app/stylesheets
	-Contains the CSS files used to style the front end application.
	
	/app/views
	-Contains the different pages of the front end application. This is 
	heavily relient upon the Angular JS framework from which the front 
	end is built.

	/app/app.js
	-This file creates the angular app and links up the views with the 
	controllers.

/bower_components------------------------------------------------------------
-Contains all the libraries and content loaded with Bower for the front 
end application.

/db--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Contains the set up scripts for the MySql database.

/fonts-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-Contains the fonts used in the front end application.

/bower.json
-See the versions of all the libraries being loaded by bower.

/index.html
-The base html file of the application. This file is the base layout on which
the rest of the views are loaded into. This file loads all the front end 
libraries, and all of the javascript files used by angular. After this page 
loads, the whole web application is loaded, except the data from the 
database. This data loads asynchronously, as the need arises.
