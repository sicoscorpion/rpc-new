----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Possible Bugs from my local version (Martin Main)
(Google chrome on linux)

Frontend:
-Menu buttons often get squashed. Doesn't scale well for some sized screens.
-Default admin screen for me buttons misplaced..
-Social media stuff doesn't do anything
-Robot logo has weird shadow

-Weird red and green bars across middle of page when page is partially loaded
-On signup page, perhaps give feedback on incorrect data AFTER the cursor has 
left the field in question.
-Why is angular_messages.js brought in from online when everything else is 
loaded locally?
-ON Create competition form - 
	-'time' should be 'date'

-ON Create qualifier form, sometimes doesn't let you, but doesn't tell you what's wrong
	
-Backend:
-Password hash being sent to client when logging in. Insecure?
-If I am an admin, then on the app, set my own position to super-admin, I lose my priviledges
-Deleting users doesn't seem to work quite right

Overall:
-A bit slow in my opinion
